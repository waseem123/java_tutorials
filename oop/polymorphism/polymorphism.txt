Polymorphism - 
Poly - Many
Morphing - changing form / changing behaviour

Taking more than one form

"A method is defined with a single name but having multiple definitions is called as Polymorphism"

exmple - 
getArea(){returns area of circle}
getArea(){returns area of rectangle}
getArea(){returns area of square}
getArea(){returns area of any random geometrical shape}

There are two types of Polymorphism
1. Compile Time / Static Binding / Method Overloading - 

getArea(int r){ return area of circle }
getArea(int l,int b){ return area of rectangle }
getArea(int l,int b, int h){ return area of triangle }

2. Run Time / Dynamic Binding / Method Overriding
